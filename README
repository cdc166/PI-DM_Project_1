# Online Auction System

This project is a simplified online auction system similar to eBay, designed to support the operations of an online auction company named "BuyMe". 
It allows users to log in/out and participate in auctions


## Database Setup

1. Open MySQL Workbench and create a new schema named `cs336project`.
2. Run the SQL script provided in `database_setup.sql` to create and populate tables.


## Running the Application

1. In Eclipse, add the project to the Tomcat Server.
	- Click on Servers in the toolbar below
	- Right click on the Tomcat server
	- Click add and remove
	- Add the project to the server 
2. Start the server and open `http://localhost:8080/OnlineAuctionSystem-CS336` in a web browser.


## Setting Environment Variables in Eclipse

You can set environment variables specific to the project in Eclipse without modifying your system's global settings. 
Useful for managing database credentials securely. Setting up environment variables in Eclipse for the MySQL user name and password:

1. Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer view.
2. Select `Run As` > `Run Configurations...`.
3. In the left pane, select your Tomcat server. If you don't see it, run the project once with the server, and it should appear.
4. Go to the `Environment` tab on the right.
5. Click `Add` to add a new environment variable.
6. Enter `MYSQL_USER` for the name and your MySQL username for the value. Repeat this process for `MYSQL_PASSWORD`.
7. Apply the changes and close the dialog.

These variables will now be used when running the project from Eclipse.
